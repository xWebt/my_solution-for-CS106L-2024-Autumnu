我写完的106l的解决方案。代码都在里面，如果要原始代码可以去106l的项目页去clone。

质量很好的assign，同时远远要比19年的assign更加清晰，完全只需要按照要求进行一步一步的实现，就能够完成整个作业。

很感谢斯坦福大学能够将这么好的课程开源，容我向伟大的开源精神致敬。刷完整个课程的收获不少，一一列举有点困难，不仅仅包括于对于 STL RAII 移动语义的了解（我能找到的课程是2019年的，但是听说斯坦福新的106l课程已经完全使用cpp20讲解了）。

后面是一些废话了，如果是需要查看code可以直接进入文件夹查看，同时我也将每一节课的ppt整理好了，也在文件里。如果你是中国人或者可以看懂汉语 ，可以在这个专栏看所有assign的题解：https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1839339107211419649

The solutions I completed for 106L. The code is all inside, and if you want the original code, you can clone it from the 106L project page.

The assignments are of very high quality and are much clearer than the ones from 2019. You can simply follow the instructions step by step to complete the entire assignment.

I'm very grateful that Stanford University has open-sourced such a great course, and I pay my respects to the great open-source spirit. Completing the entire course was quite rewarding, and it's difficult to list everything I gained, which includes an understanding of STL, RAII, and move semantics (the course I found is from 2019, but I've heard that the new 106L course at Stanford is entirely taught using C++20).

The following is some extra talk. If you need to view the code, you can directly go to the folder. I've also organized the PowerPoint slides for each lesson, which are included in the file.

继续废话（bushi）

鼠鼠来自一个中国内的双非一本。选择计算机专业后，兴冲冲的冲进大学，妄图成为一个臆想当中的“计算机大神”，结果开学后的疫情首先就给我当头一棒。

无尽的网课，稀碎的课程质量，对着ppt讲解的课程，陈旧的课本。一件一件让我对后面该做什么事情失去了方向。

后面，大一下半学期，接触到了ACM。虽然现在看来，我在上面花费了相当多的时间但是一无所获，但是无论怎么说，它让我认识了不少志同道合的人，也在大学前两年的时间内给我了相当多的乐趣。

时间流逝，大二下半学期根本不打算考研的我，不得不面对就业的现实。**梦醒了**。于是我在群聊内，网络上，各个论坛开始了解如何学习计算机。CSDIY就是这时进入我的视线的。

我第一门学完的课程就是MIT 的missing semester，这门课程教会我许多有用的东西，也给我后面的自学之路奠定了基础，让我碰到各种命令都不至于蒙圈。

从某种意义上来说，这门课程是我完整完成的第二个公开课，写下这段文字的时候，心里感慨良多，我不知道以后的路该怎么办。通过自学真能在内卷严重的中国国内找到工作吗？

虽然带着迷茫，但是我还是在路上了。一路走来，感谢对我帮助过的各个论坛的、QQ群聊的大佬，感谢各个平台给我提供帮助的资料。

当我写下这篇文字的时候，已经是 2024-11-24 凌晨的四点了，也该睡觉了。怀着我的“大厂梦”，希望几年后的我看到这段文字的时候已经如愿以偿。

最后用句 典故表达一下我的心情：

Just more rambling (not really).

I come from a second-tier university in China. After choosing computer science, I excitedly entered university, hoping to become a "computer master" in my imagination, but the pandemic hit right after the semester started, and that was a huge setback for me.

Endless online classes, fragmented course quality, courses taught from PPTs, outdated textbooks. One thing after another made me lose direction on what I should be doing next.

Later, in the second semester of my freshman year, I came across ACM. Although now it seems that I spent a lot of time on it without gaining much, it did help me meet many like-minded people and brought me a lot of joy during the first two years of university.

Time passed, and in the second semester of my sophomore year, not intending to take the graduate school entrance exam, I had to face the reality of employment. I woke up from my dream. So, I began to look into how to learn computer science through group chats, online forums, and various other places. That's when CSDIY came into my view.

The first course I finished was MIT's "Missing Semester." This course taught me a lot of useful things and laid the foundation for my self-learning journey, so I wouldn't be clueless when I encountered various commands.

In a sense, this course was the second online course I completed in its entirety. Writing this now, I feel so emotional. I don’t know what the future holds. Can self-learning really lead to a job in China, where the competition is fierce?

Though I’m filled with uncertainty, I’m still on the road. Along the way, I’m grateful to all the people who helped me on various forums, QQ groups, and the resources provided by various platforms.

As I write this, it's already 4 AM on November 24, 2024, and it's time to sleep. With my "dream of joining a big tech company," I hope that when I read this a few years from now, I’ll have achieved my goal.

best wishes !
